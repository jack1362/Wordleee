# Wordleee
This was a program that was made for the end of year project for AP Computer Science Principles

This program is coded in python, it's a game called "Wordleee."
I took inspration from the game "Wordle" which was originally published by The New York Times.
It takes and displays user input on the screen using the pygame package.
You can input/delete letters to make words. The goal is to guess the correct randomized word.
The program will show you which letters you got correct or partially correct.
