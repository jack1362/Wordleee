# Wordleee: A Word Guessing Game
This was a simplistic program that was made for the end of year project for AP Computer Science Principles

This project is a Python implementation of a word-guessing game inspired by "Wordle,"\n
which was originally published by The New York Times. It uses OOP and the Pygame library\n
for rendering the interface.\n\n

Gameplay:\n
  Players attempt to guess a randomly selected five letter word within five attempts.\n
  After each guess, the game provides fedback by color-coding letters\n
    - Green: Correct letter in correct position\n
    - Correct letter in wrong position\n
    - Letter not present in the correct word\n\n

Interaction:\n
  The game accepted keyboard input for entering letters, deleting letters (backspace), and submitting guesses (enter key).\n
  Visual input is displayed directly on the interface to lead the player towards the correct answer.\n
